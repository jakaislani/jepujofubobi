His birth name was Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At an early age, young Clay showed that he wasn’t afraid of any bout—inside or outside of the ring. Growing up in the segregated South, he experienced racial prejudice and discrimination firsthand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of 12, Clay discovered his talent for boxing through an odd twist of fate. After his bike was stolen, Clay told police officer Joe Martin that he wanted to beat up the thief. “Well, you better learn how to fight before you start challenging people,” Martin reportedly told him at the time. In addition to being a police officer, Martin also trained young boxers at a local gym.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clay started working with Martin to learn how to spar and soon began his boxing career. In his first amateur bout in 1954, he won the fight by split decision. Clay went on to win the 1956 Golden Gloves tournament for novices in the light heavyweight class. Three years later, he won the National Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, as well as the Amateur Athletic Union’s national title for the light heavyweight division.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clay attended mostly Black public schools, including Central High School in Louisville from 1956 to 1960.

However, the school’s principal Atwood Wilson could see Clay’s potential and opposed this, sarcastically asking the staff, “Do you think I’m going to be the principal of a school that Cassius Clay didn’t finish?”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Muhammad Ali - Mini Biography" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/7321d6e9-4c7f-41d2-9337-d414cf180d28/thumb_640x360_00002_1673369422_27505.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Olympic Gold" data-anchor-id=olympic-gold class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Olympic Gold</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1960, Clay won a spot on the U.S. Olympic boxing team and traveled to Rome to compete. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Clay was an imposing figure in the ring, but he also became known for his lightning speed and fancy footwork. After winning his first three bouts, Clay defeated Zbigniew Pietrzkowski of Poland to win the light heavyweight Olympic gold medal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his Olympic victory, Clay was heralded as an American hero.
